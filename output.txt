"It was the friar Gomita,"


"He of Gallura, vessel of all guile, Who had his master's enemies in hand, And us'd them so that they commend him well. Money he took, and them at large dismiss'd. So he reports: and in each other charge Committed to his keeping, play'd the part Of barterer to the height:  with him doth herd The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche. Sardinia is a theme, whereof their tongue Is never weary.  Out! alas! behold That other, how he grins!  More would I say, But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore."


"Off! cursed bird!  Avaunt!"


"If ye desire to see or hear,"


"or Tuscan spirits Or Lombard, I will cause them to appear. Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury, So that no vengeance they may fear from them, And I, remaining in this self-same place, Will for myself but one, make sev'n appear, When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so Our custom is to call each other up."


"Hear his device, Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down."


"Mischief forsooth extreme, Meant only to procure myself more woe!"


"If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot Will chase thee, but above the pitch will beat My plumes.  Quit we the vantage ground, and let The bank be as a shield, that we may see If singly thou prevail against us all."
